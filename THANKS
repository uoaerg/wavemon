Many people contribute to wavemon by reporting problems, suggesting various
improvements, or submitting actual code. Here is a list of these people. Help
me (gerrit@erg.abdn.ac.uk) keep it complete and accurate.

Christoph J. Thompson (cjsthompson@gmail.com) provided DESTDIR support for
the installation process and contributed a Slackware build script, found in
the contrib folder (2009-03-03).

Tom Gordon to help fix a build error occurring under Puppy Linux, in wavemon
version 0.5 (2009-02-06).

Dave W. Capella (dave.capella@cornell.edu) provided modifications to build
ipkg packages for mobile devices in 2002 (now in contrib/).

Nelson A. de Oliveira provided helpful tips for choosing a sensible screen-size
default, and helped much to reduce annoyances in keeping the configuration-file
parser backward-compatible (0.6.7).

Jonathan Lovelace  provided a patch to enable build on Gentoo (0.6.10).
Hanno Boeck supplied a patch to improve the linking process (0.6.10).

Sean Muir helped improve the overall design through several really useful
suggestions (histogram levels, scan window) leading up to 0.7.0.

Jean Tourrilhes helped with the scan window in 0.7.0 (most of the code to
extract the scan data is from wireless tools 30) and also kindly provided
an earlier wavemon prototype with scanning support.

Thanks to Matt who helped fixing several bugs in 0.7.0.

Robert M. Stockmann and Koniu helped with bug fixes in 0.7.1; thanks to Koniu
support for window resizing got started.

Jonathan McCrohan fixed manpage compilation errors in 0.7.4.
